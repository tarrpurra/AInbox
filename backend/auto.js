    `Hi Team,

The Q3 Budget Report has been finalized and uploaded to the shared drive. Please review it before our meeting this Friday. 

Some key points to note:
- We came in under budget by 6%, primarily due to reduced travel and event expenses.
- Marketing spend was 10% lower than projected, which contributed to lower lead generation in September.
- We are slightly behind on product development milestones and will need to reallocate some resources.

In our Friday meeting, weâ€™ll discuss:
1. Adjustments for Q4 spending
2. Revised targets for product delivery
3. Holiday season marketing strategy

Please come prepared with any questions or suggestions.

Best,  
Alex
